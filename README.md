# Tweet Classification

General Assembly Data Science Immersime Capstone Project

This capstone project deals with the extraction of topic-related
tweets on twitter through binary classification of topic-related
tweets against an unfiltered stream.  The project uses a selection of
tweets gathered using keywords from a selection of video game brands
along with an unfiltered stream as a training set.  Tweets are
cleaned, processed with LSA, and fed into a grid of machine learning
methods for classification.
