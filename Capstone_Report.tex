\begin{abstract}
\PRE{\vspace*{.3in}} In this project I considered a classification
scheme for tweets on twitter.  I considered a data set of forty
thousand tweets, evenly split between unfiltered tweets and a sample
generated from a keyword filter using names of video game franchises.
I trained a set of machine learning estimators using half the data
set, resulting in cross-validation accuracies of between 75\% and 83\%
on the training set and 76\% for the best model on the validation set.
I also outline the possible methods for organizing topic-related
tweets into clusters based on genre or topic.
